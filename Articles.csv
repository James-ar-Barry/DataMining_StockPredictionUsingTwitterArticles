"The S&P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average on Wednesday, its first time under that widely watched indicator since Election Day, which has some chart analysts worried the bullish trend put in place since President Donald Trump's win is reversing.

The historical data shows there is reason for concern.

S&P 500, 6 months with 50-day moving average:

Using hedge fund analystics tool Kensho, CNBC analyzed 245 occasions when the S&P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average since 1990. A week later, the stock benchmark was lower by 1 percent, on average, while bonds and gold were in the green.

A month later, the results were much of the same, according to Kensho, with the S&P 500 lower and gold and bonds higher.

Looking a little further out, things start to recover. The S&P 500 is up by 1.14 percent, on average, six months after a 50-day negative breach.

Bottom line: History shows Wednesday's weak close is cause for short-term concern.

"HP shares climbed on Wednesday after the stock was upgraded to ""buy"" by Citi analyst Jim Suva, who expects the company to continue to gain PC market share.

The stock was the top mover in the S&P 500 on Wednesday morning, with shares closing up more than 2 percent.

HP is moving toward more premium products, including hybrids and gaming, that could drive it to make gains as the PC market is revived, Suva wrote.

Citi's upgrade comes on the heels of new data from IDC, which said that global shipments of PCs increased for the first time on an annualized basis since the first quarter of 2012. HP got the top market share for the first times since the beginning of 2013, with 13.1 million shipments, according to IDC.

Positive trends in the U.S. economy — including strong employment data and high consumer confidence — signal that demand may continue, Suva wrote. The unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.5 percent in March, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said last week, though job creation fell short of estimates, as did a measure of consumer sentiment.

UBS analyst Steven Milunovich wrote on Wednesday that he's bullish on the stock, noting the PC revival and a stabilization in the printer market.

""We think investor skepticism provides fuel for further gains,"" Milunovich wrote.

"There's been a lot of excitement about the U.S. earnings season, and with good reason: S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow roughly 10 percent, led by roughly 15 percent gains in the two largest sectors, Technology and Financials.

But the slow improvement in the global economy has analysts even more bullish on investing outside the U.S. Goldman Sachs is anticipating first-quarter earnings will be up 17 percent for the STOXX Europe 600, which represents a basket of stocks across 17 European countries, and 16 percent for Japanese stocks. Even Emerging Markets are seeing an improving earnings picture.

The picture is the same for the full year: across the board, overseas earnings estimates look better than the U.S.:

(estimates)



S&P 500: up 10.0 percent

Japan: up 12.1 percent

Europe: up 14.4 percent

Emerging Markets: up 19.3 percent Source: JPMorgan Cazenove

Investors have responded. Overseas markets have either performed in-line or outperformed U.S. markets year-to-date:

Global markets 2017

(YTD)



S&P 500: up 5.5 percent

Europe (STOXX 600): up 5.5 percent

Phillipines: up 11.3 percent

Indonesia: up 6.5 percent

Japan (Topix): down 2 percent Source: JPMorgan Cazenove

The exception to the outperformance--Japan--has had problems because of a stronger yen.

What's behind the spurt in earnings?

Economic growth is picking up overseas. While U.S. GDP is improving, expected to go from 1.6 percent to 2.1 percent in 2017, GDP growth is also improving in the Eurozone (2 percent in 2017), Japan (1.7 percent, a notable improvement over the anemic 1 percent growth in 2016), and Emerging markets (4.6 percent), according to JPMorgan Cazenove. Corporate pricing power has improved. Oil, for example, has bottomed. Oil prices are considered proxies for global growth; global earnings momentum is also strongly linked to commodity prices in general, which began rising last year.

Stronger growth and better pricing power alone will be a boost to corporate margins. But there are other positive factors:

Stocks are cheaper overseas. Europe is trading at 15.3x 2017 earnings, well south of the roughly 18.4 multiple the S&P 500 sports. So is Japan (15.6), and Emerging Markets (12.5), according to JPMorgan Cazenove. The U.S. business cycle is in a late stage, but not so overseas. Political risk may be fading in Europe. That risk--first from the Netherlands election and still from the upcoming French election--held European equities back in January and February but those concerns have faded recently, as Goldman Sachs recently noted, pointing out that the Europe-over-the-U.S.-trade ""has further to go as Europe tends to outperform when global growth is strong and political risk is fading."" Government bond yields bottomed in Europe in September, and in January for Japan. This has been supportive for banks. A more stable dollar has been a big help to emerging markets.

What could go wrong?



Currency fluctuations are big issues when dealing with global stock flows. Japanese stocks have suffered due to a stronger yen. The biggest risk is a sudden surge in the dollar, which would hurt the reflation trade and likely lead to more capital outflow from Emerging Markets. The weaker euro has recently acted as a help for earnings in Europe, though it's doubtful that will continue.",2017-04-10
"Morgan Stanley says a 30% surge in stocks could be ahead Monday, 10 Apr 2017 | 12:30 PM ET | 00:48

Morgan Stanley has a new chief U.S. equity strategist in town, and he's uber-bullish on stocks in 2017.

"President Donald Trump's firing of Tomahawk missiles on a Syrian air base should lift the price of defense stocks past the market benchmark next week, according to a CNBC analysis of historic data.

Using hedge fund analytics tool Kensho, we looked at the performance of defense stocks and the S&P 500 a week following significant developments in the Syrian civil war. There have been more than 200 major events during the conflict in the last six years, including those involving the U.S., Russia, Turkey, the U.K. and France.

Here is the performance of the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF, major defense shares and the S&P 500 a week after such events:

The major defense stocks, including Raytheon, which makes the Tomahawk missiles used in Thursday's airstrikes, all beat the market during the week following an escalation of the conflict, on average.

Oil and Treasurys also beat the S&P 500 in the week following an event, yet gold underperforms, according to Kensho.

"The Federal Reserve March meeting minutes indicated central bank officials are worried the stock market's multiple has become a bit too rich.

""Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased over the intermeeting period, and some measures of valuations, such as price-to-earnings ratios, rose further above historical norms,"" the minutes said. ""Some participants viewed equity prices as quite high relative to standard valuation measures.""

If the Fed is right and the P/E ratio is in for a contraction, it's doesn't necessarily mean the end of the bull market, or even that stocks will decline, history shows. An analysis using hedge fund analytics tool Kensho found the S&P 500 can still manage to rise during annual periods of multiple compression as earnings (the denominator in the P/E ratio) catch up.

The chart below shows the median return of the S&P 500 during years in the last two decades when the index's trailing P/E declined. The compression happened during nine of those years (2000, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2014). We used a median return because the 40 percent loss in 2008 due to the market price plunge after the financial crisis skews the results. Also included in the chart are the four best sector performers during those years, ranked by median return.",2017-04-06
"It looks like stocks and crude are starting to pay closer attention to each other.

In the past few months, as stocks surged while crude stagnated and then slumped, the commodity and the measure of large-cap stocks actually began to experience an inverse relationship. That is, on a day when oil settled lower, stocks were more likely to rise than to fall.

Since then, the pair has begun to enjoy a closer relationship. Over the past 60 sessions, WTI crude oil and the S&P 500 have seen a correlation of about 0.28. While this hardly suggests that they are identical twins, it does imply that oil's daily move is now more relevant to equities.

""The dollar has come under some pressure of late and this pushes up oil as well as the U.S. dollar value of offshore earnings,"" Max Wolff, market strategist at 55 Capital, wrote to CNBC. ""This generally increases correlation.""

In other words, currency moves are driving both stocks and oil.

But for a truly brotherly relationship between the S&P and crude, one must go back to early 2016, when oil's fall into the mid-$20s, and subsequent rebound, led it to be a primary focus for stock investors.

Looking forward, traders say oil is likely to remain in its recent wide range.

Most traders ""can't see any reason for it to go any higher. And technically, between $48 and $54 seems to be a very comfortable spot for crude oil right here,"" Harvest Volatility Management portfolio Manager Dennis Davitt said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""

From a fundamental perspective U.S. producers have become so efficient, ""they can operate at $50 a barrel, and they will just keep flooding the market as long as the price keeps staying at these levels.""

"After the most dramatic reversal in 14 months, stocks could face another next big test Thursday.

""The real test is whether the market will fall below and close below the 50-day moving average, which it hasn't done since Election Day. That would be a signal the complexion has changed, and that would breed more caution,"" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com.

The 50-day moving average for the S&P 500 is 2,344. It is viewed as a support level, based on the average closing price over the last 50 sessions. Breaking beneath that level could be viewed as a negative for stock prices.

The S&P 500, after rallying above 2,370, a key resistance level, reversed course sharply Wednesday and closed down 7 at 2,352.

Stocks rallied early in the day, but sold off in the afternoon, after the Fed spooked the market with comments on equities being highly priced. Shortly after the Fed released its 2 p.m. minutes, House Speaker Paul Ryan was quoted as saying that tax reform could take longer than the overhaul of health care. Ironically, the Fed had noted that the market may have been boosted by expectations for corporate tax reform.

Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS, said the release of the minutes from the Fed's last meeting was a turning point for stocks, which he said also obsessed over Fed comments that it could begin to wind down its balance sheet this year. That is a move that bond strategists say could push interest rates higher.

Redler, who follows the market's short-term technicals, said the dramatic reversal in the S&P 500 Wednesday may be a forewarning of more turbulence to come.

""When you break key levels and hold them, it's a constructive signal for the bulls. If you push above levels and it fails, it could give you some clues that there's more weakness to come. The banks and small caps were giving clues even before the Fed said the market is quite high,"" said Redler.

Redler said the push above 2,365/2,370 drew in traders who were confident the market gains would hold, and it also flushed out shorts. But the reversal trapped the investors with new positions, and the selling became more powerful as they bailed out.

""Today was your day to take notice,"" Redler said.

The Dow was down 41 at 20,648, and the Nasdaq was down 34 at 5,864. The Dow had been up more than 200 points earlier in the session.

"The CNBC IQ 100 gained 6.8 percent in the first quarter, outpacing the S&P 500's 5.5 percent gain. CNBC's exclusive, rules-based index also notched a 1 percent gain in March, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 lost ground.

As part of its rules-based methodology, the index has been re-weighted for the second quarter. Microsoft will remain the highest-weighted company in the index for the second straight quarter. MCAM International, the firm whose proprietary algorithms power the CNBC IQ 100, executed the re-weighting for CNBC.

""Microsoft scores very well across multiple industry sectors, including intelligent cloud applications and management, mobile operating systems, industrial internet and connected devices, and hardware and software for distributed gaming systems,"" says MCAM managing director David Pratt.

The companies in the CNBC IQ 100 Index are weighted according to each one's ability to invest in, develop, control and deploy intellectual property to achieve strategic advantage over competitors. Companies with the highest weighting maintain this type of advantage across multiple industries. Pratt says Microsoft beat out its competitors in a total of 12 distinct business types, more than any other company in the index.

With the re-weighting, chipmaker Micron Technology moves from being the fourth-highest weighted company in the first quarter to being equally weighted with JPMorgan Chase and tied for the second-highest weight in the second quarter. Boeing and Dow Chemical will remain the other companies in the top 5.

The index is re-weighted quarterly, and components are rebalanced annually. Micron was one of 10 companies added to the index at the start of 2017, replacing Intel. Micron shares jumped 30 percent in the first quarter, the biggest gainer among the 100 stocks in the index. ExxonMobil was the index's biggest loser in the first quarter, with a decline of almost 9.5 percent.",2017-04-04
"However, Cramer's top five names for the second quarter are all first-quarter winners, the top performers in the S&P 500 that should continue their ascents barring any major crises along the way.

First up is NRG Energy, a utility giant that has managed to climb over 52 percent this year after a period of weakness. Cramer said the country's largest competitive energy provider is still revamping operations, and that it would not surprise him if the stock ticked up even more.

Cramer then turned to Vertex, a biotechnology company focused on finding cystic fibrosis treatments that has see promising responses to its latest trials .

""Vertex has climbed up to $107 here, but ... [it] traded in the $140s back when the market first thought it had developed something good for cystic fibrosis before a setback, so I think this one has more room to run,"" Cramer said.

Third, Cramer tapped the contradictory Arconic, formerly Alcoa, an aerospace and defense play that has been at the center of a proxy fight between activist investor Elliott Management and Arconic's own CEO, Klaus Kleinfeld.

""We own Arconic for my charitable trust, and I've told club members that it simply wouldn't be this high without that fight from Elliott, and that makes the stock a little fraught at these levels, even as it's down four bucks from its highs,"" Cramer said. ""It's too cheap on the possibility of a takeover, ... but it's too expensive on earnings.""

Fourth and most actionable is video game maker Activision Blizzard, creator of the popular Call of Duty franchise and an integral name to own in the age of the stay-at-home economy.

""Of all the winners so far, I think this is the one that you can buy right here, right now, and then hopefully buy even more of on a pullback,"" Cramer said.

Cramer ended with Incyte, a pharmaceutical player that on Sunday announced it would combine one of its anti-cancer drugs with a Bristol-Myers Squibb treatment for a clinical development program.

A similar deal between Incyte and Merck has Wall Street rumoring a takeover, but Cramer isn't totally sold.

""I don't recommend a stock solely on the basis of takeover speculation,"" he said. ""But takeover or no takeover, here's where I come down: I actually believe that Incyte sells for a lot less than its key drug franchise is worth, which is why I'm giving you my blessing to buy it into the profit-taking that I think is a natural next step in the wake of the stock's big run today.""

Cramer insisted that he is not turning bearish, simply seeking the bargains that a near-term dip could provide.

""I am happy to wait for lower prices. But if we don't get them, you know what? Then that will mean I was too cautious. It's always a possibility, but after such a strong start to the year, please don't mind me if I want to get a little picky before I end up pulling the trigger,"" Cramer said.

"Best quarter ever for ETF flows Friday, 31 Mar 2017 | 2:04 PM ET | 03:25

The bullish beginning of 2017 did more than set a sizzling pace for the year — it actually pulled some long-dormant cash off the sidelines.

As the S&P 500 gained 4.7 percent, and bonds managed to stay above water, investors yanked about $75 billion out of low-yielding money market accounts and put it to work, according to data from the Investment Company Institute and TrimTabs. The total represented about 2.7 percent of all assets.

"After a weak March, April isn't starting off any better.

Recent performance is raising the possibility of a market correction that would bring valuations more in line with corporate earnings, and it would take at least a 20 percent decline in the S&P 500 for price-to-earnings ratios to return to their recent averages.

High valuations are just one of many factors that could be signs of a correction in the near future. Analysts have also pointed to falling commodity prices and political disappointments that could usher in a downturn. Other investors are hoping for a correction to keep the market healthy and in line with fundamentals.

"A veteran Wall Street strategist says the markets just dipped below a technical level, which could give investors a chance to pounce.

Raymond James' chief investment strategist, Jeffrey Saut, is referring to what happened on Wednesday, when both the S&P 500 and Dow closed below their 50-day moving averages for the first time since the week Donald Trump won the presidential election.

Saut is characterizing it as a""very short-term red flag"" — one which will likely morph into a solid buying opportunity as earnings season begins.

""It could indicate that we would finally get a test of that 2,270-2,280 level,"" Saut said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""If we get that, I'd put money to work.""

There already seems to be skittishness surrounding stocks just hours before JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo become among the first major companies to report their latest quarterly results.

""Complacency is pretty high right here,"" said Saut. ""The S&P was trading around 2,350 in mid-February, and that's pretty much where it's traded up until the past few hours.""

When asked about the notion that the markets are lodged in a ""Taylor Swift-like shake it off market ,"" Saut didn't seem too concerned. The idea is derived from a trend that stocks have been staying within 2 percent of their closing highs despite serious geopolitical risks overseas in areas such as Syria and North Korea.

""I think you would have to watch out for a black swan event. If there was a nuclear incident with North Korea, that would certainly give you a 5 to 10 percent correction,"" he cautioned.

Yet Saut, who has about 25 percent of his money in cash right now, believes the odds of that kind of situation emerging are low. He's also optimistic that earnings season will bode very well for stocks.

He's most positive about financials and technology, which make up more than one-third of the S&P 500.

""I'm expecting good things out of both of those sectors,"" Saut said. ""Longer term, I still think we're in a secular bull market that has years left to run.""

"This usually happens after the VIX jumps 25%+ in one week Tuesday, 11 Apr 2017 | 12:57 PM ET | 00:16

U.S. stocks fell, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average closed at two-month lows Thursday.

""I'd say it's probably more of a Trump trade [reversing] than the geopolitics, but going forward I think the geopolitics is the topic the market is focusing on,"" said Andres Jaime, global FX and rates strategist at Barclays.

Meanwhile, tensions around North Korea are heating up as the communist state has warned of a nuclear attack on the U.S., which has sent a Navy strike group toward the western Pacific. North Korea celebrates the birth of its founder Kim Il Sung on Saturday.

VIX 12-month performance

Source: FactSet

The fear index on Thursday hit 16.22, its highest since Nov. 10, after closing above its 200-day moving average on Monday for the first time since Nov. 8.

""The VIX confirmed a breakout above its 200-day moving average [Tuesday], supporting a pickup in volatility in the days ahead,"" BTIG's chief technical strategist, Katie Stockton, said in a Wednesday note.

""We expect the inversely correlated SPX to break its 50-day moving average in a short-term setback that will lead to a retest of March's low"" of 2,322, she said.

A key factor for the renewed fear was concern about geopolitical events such as tensions with North Korea, the conflict in Syria, or the French elections.

The geopolitical risk has been known for some time, but ""now it's creating a critical mass,"" said Dan Veru, chief investment officer at Palisade Capital Management. ""The market's being forced to recognize the impact [from] global disruption.""

""You're seeing significant institutional demand for protection. Right or wrong, their models are indicating now there's an increased risk of further market disruption,"" he said.

In another concerning move, the S&P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average Wednesday for the first time since Election Day.

However, the VIX is also still well below its historical highs. The index hit a 52-week high last June of 26.7, and Veru pointed out on Wednesday that VIX futures for May and June actually point to a decline in the fear index.

""That tells you based on what options players feel, that there's a great deal of risk on the near-term time horizon and they don't see as much risk in May as they see right now in April,"" he said.

The major U.S. averages also remain within 3 percent of their all-time highs.

""A deeper pullback would be constructive in that it would generate short-term oversold conditions within the framework of the long-term uptrend,"" Stockton said.

"On Thursday morning, investors got a read on the health of the big financials after three of the largest U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup reported first quarter earnings reports.

Higher costs and weaker mortgage revenue were to blame for Wells Fargo's mixed report as the nation's third-largest bank by assets is still struggling with the fallout over its sales scandal revealed last year.

Citigroup easily topped Wall Street's estimates, reporting earnings of $1.35 on revenue of $18.12 billion. The beat was driven by strong growth in the bank's consumer and institutional businesses.

Finally, JPMorgan reported earnings of $1.65 on revenue of $25.58 billion. The firm's trading revenue reached $6.52 billion, soaring past forecasts.

Since the end of the financial crisis, JPMorgan has topped first-quarter earnings estimates 88 percent of the time, with 2014 the only earnings miss - excluding this morning's report.

This is a great track record on paper, but in the short-term, it doesn't necessarily bode well for the stock.

Using hedge fund analytics tool Kensho, CNBC ran a study to see how JPMorgan performs in the week following its first quarter results.

Despite the high batting average for beats, JPMorgan has actually traded negatively 88 percent of the time in the following week, with an average loss of 1.43 percent—2016 logged the only positive return in that period.

The Financial SPDR (XLF) also tends to head lower in this period, trading negatively 63 percent of the time, with an average loss of 0.5 percent.

"The Japanese yen's relationship to the U.S. dollar may be at a critical level, potentially signaling a warning for the equity market.

The dollar dropped in Friday trading to 108.71 against the yen , its lowest level since mid-November. Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, said the dollar/yen broke a crucial level to the downside when it slid below 110 this week.

""I think that's a very, very serious sign suggesting that risk-off is really starting to permeate through the markets because in my opinion, yen always leads the markets in terms of risk-off sentiment,"" he said, adding that fear first appears in the currency market and then ""spreads"" into the equity market.

Schlossberg pointed to investors growing increasingly concerned about geopolitical uncertainty particularly in Korea, about the general tightening of credit conditions, and ""the fact that there is very little progress on the reflation front out of D.C.""

""We've had a big disconnect between what the currencies have been saying and what the equities have been saying, and I think now we're reaching a breaking point where the currencies are really signaling that equities need to come in and correct,"" he said Wednesday in an interview on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""

Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, echoes Schlossberg's sentiment concerning the yen triggering pressure on equities. He said the dollar/yen could fall to 105 over the next three months, and calls the S&P 500 ""frothy"" at these levels.

Along with the yen, the long end of the yield curve is also pointing to the economy not accelerating as much as the market expects, Morganlander said.

The greenback fell to its 200-day moving average against the yen in early trading, observed Win Thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.

""The subsequent stabilization looks fragile, and the JPY107.90 area may be the next target, which corresponds to a 61.8% retracement of the rally since the US election,"" Thin wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.",2017-04-13
"""I think depending on the severity of it, we have a pullback or a correction but because of the economic indicators I'm looking at, I'm not worried a recession is around the corner, and as a result, I don't think we're heading for a bear market,"" Stovall said.

The bond market has been a big beneficiary of this ""geopolitical"" trade, with the 10-year Treasury yield breaking below a range it has been in for months. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite to prices, had been trading steadily between 2.30 and 2.60 percent since mid-November.

This week, buying took the yield to a low of 2.21 percent and strategists say it could fall even further.

Aaron Kohli, rate strategist at BMO, said the market is definitely trading on fears about North Korea and other geopolitical events, but the big change in market attitude was in March, when Republicans failed to pass a new health-care bill. That legislation was seen as a necessary step ahead of tax reform, and markets now see both as in limbo.

""It's been about reading the tea leaves of the health-care failure, and it's been slowly taking back some of the inflation and growth expectations,"" said Kohli. ""It's been the crescendo with these [geopolitical] headlines, or tape bombs.""

The worries about North Korea and Syria come at the same time global investors are already on edge about the potential for the National Front candidate Marine Le Pen to win the French presidential election. While not expected, a victory by Le Pen could lead to France leaving the euro zone. The first round vote is April 23, and the second round is May 7.

""While people are shifting some risk, there's a general belief [former French Economy Minister Emmanuel] Macron is going to be the winner,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. ""The most important thing people should be focused on is are we going to get tax reform, and what the formulation is going to be. It's apparently not what people entered the year hoping for, and they should also pay attention to the fact that central banks around the world are taking away the punch bowl.""



Boockvar said ultimately geopolitical fears don't last that long, but they have created important technical moves against the backdrop of a market that could be disappointed by what stimulus comes out of Washington. The bond market, he said has also been moving on concerns the Fed will keep raising rates while the economy is not growing that much.

But the fact geopolitical tensions have been running high has clearly filtered through to markets. On Wednesday, stocks cut some losses and the dollar strengthened after Russia and the U.S. showed a willingness to work on their relationship and some thorny issues like Syria and North Korea.

""On the margin, it's an easing of tension. ... The U.S. missile attack is not the beginning of a wholesale military involvement in Syria. North Korea, not clear,"" said Marc Chandler, Brown Brothers Harriman head of foreign exchange strategy.

U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson held a news briefing with his Russian counterpart Wednesday, committed to working together despite apparent disagreement.

Shortly after the briefing, President Donald Trump was quoted in a Wall Street Journal report saying he believes the dollar was too strong and that he likes low interest rates. That sent the greenback reeling and it was still under pressure Thursday.

That in turn helped gold, which already crossed above its 200-day moving average in the spot market this week. Gold futures were at $1,286 per ounce in Thursday trading, and gold is seen as the ultimate safe hold. Gold futures were up 2.4 percent week to date.

Suki Cooper, precious metals analyst at Standard Chartered Bank, said the metal could easily go to $1,300 and trade higher above that psychological threshold in the near term. ""The weakness we've seen in the dollar has certainly helped gold extend its gains,"" she said.

Cooper said there has not been this much investor interest since the Brexit vote last June and around the U.S. election. ""This time its geopolitics that stoked the safe haven demand,"" she said.

""It looks like there's a good base for gold prices here, and I would expect prices to extend their gains,"" she said.

"Blame it on the bunny.

Every year, dozens of companies reference the Easter holiday in their earnings conference calls. From lingerie to soft drinks to airline tickets, companies across the S&P 500 expect to get a basketful of extra revenue from the holiday in late March or early April, but it doesn't always work out.

Any company expecting a boost in the first quarter like we saw last year is counting its Easter eggs before they hatch. That's because the holiday doesn't fall in the same quarter every year — instead, it's on the first Sunday after the first full moon occurring on or after the vernal equinox. That means it could be any day between March 22 and April 25. This year, it's April 16.

Last year was special, with the holiday falling in March, as it also did in 2013 and 2008. With Easter shifting back to April this year, first-quarter results are going to look weak when compared to last year. Executives will be sure to throw the Easter bunny under the bus.",2017-04-13
"Leon Cooperman, chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors, expects the market to be flat through the summer due to uncertainty over President Donald Trump's economic agenda.

""It is time for the U.S. equity market to rest,"" Cooperman wrote in the April 7 letter to clients.

As a result of the domestic political uncertainty, geopolitics and market valuation, the hedge fund manager expects the U.S. stock market will be ""trendless/uninteresting at around current levels for a number of months,"" he wrote.

Cooperman then predicts the bull market will resume if Washington doesn't get in the way.

""Our core views remain that the in-place U.S. equity bull market should persist for quite a while longer and that U.S. fixed income securities are unattractive,"" stated the letter. ""As we will see, a principal risk to our expectation for a pleasant U.S. share landscape is a political one, an inability of President Trump and the Republican Congress to deliver on their pro-growth economic agenda.""

His fund barely edged past the stock market last quarter, according to the letter. The Omega Capital Partners LP fund generated a 6.5 percent first-quarter net return versus the S&P 500 total return of 6.1 percent.

Cooperman founded Omega Advisors in 1991. The firm has approximately $3.6 billion assets under management currently, according to its website. That's way down from their peak after the SEC accused Cooperman of insider trading last year, allegations that he said as recently as last week that are without merit.

The market will ""lift moderately, likely to new highs"" after August and September as investors gets more ""clarity"" on what parts of President Trump's economic agenda will be implemented, the note states.



""The reflation trade has stalled,"" he wrote. ""This odd combination of an equity market lifting on better growth expectations while risk-off asset classes and sectors outperform may possibly suggest less investor confidence in the U.S. economic and earnings growth outlook and economic policy.""

"Mark 2016 as the latest Year of the Stock Picker that wasn't.

Active funds stumbled through another brutal year, with barely 1 in 3 large-cap managers able to beat the S&P 500, according to figures released Wednesday by S&P Dow Jones Indices. The news got worse farther down the scale, with 89.4 percent of mid-cap managers falling short and 85.5 percent of small-cap managers missing.

Things didn't get better over longer time frames either, with most managers falling short over 1-, 3-, 5-, 10- and 15-year spans.

The numbers come amid a pitched market debate over the benefits of active against passive management, and seemingly annual predictions that stock-picking finally will prevail.

Active managers oversee funds for which they move in and out of individual stocks, utilizing a variety of strategies, while passive funds track indexes and don't employ professional managers. Active funds generally carry much higher fees.

Investors have been shoveling money into passive strategies. Exchange-traded funds, most of which track indexes, saw record inflows of cash during the first quarter on both the stock and bond side. In 2016, passive funds attracted a net $508.4 billion while active suffered $340.1 billion in outflows, according to Morningstar.

""Its been a dismal backdrop in a dismal environment for active. The numbers prove that,"" said Nick Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex. ""Does that mean that environment will last forever? Markets always go in cycles.""

Colas believes a decline in correlations, or the tendency of stocks to move in unison that has been pronounced during the current bull market, will benefit active managers looking to capitalize on pricing discrepancies.",2017-04-12
"One of the most well-respected activist hedge fund managers believes the market is over-valued Wednesday, 12 Apr 2017 | 10:14 AM ET | 00:53

ValueAct's Jeff Ubben, one of the most-respected activist hedge fund managers out there, is returning capital to his investors because he is concerned about the stock market's high valuation.

""The broader market context is explicit to us. The S&P 500's median P/E ratio is 18 times. For most high quality companies we follow, it is much higher,"" Ubben wrote in the April 3 letter to clients. ""These valuations can only be justified by assuming cyclically high corporate margins will persist, a certainty of lower corporate tax rates and a risk-free rate that stays near all-time lows. We are skeptical of all of the above.""

The hedge fund will return $1.25 billion in capital to its limited partners starting on May 1. Ubben cited the higher-than-normal cash balances in the fund ranging from 10 percent to 29 percent since the end of 2015 versus the 5 percent average during the last decade.

""Over the remainder of 2017, we anticipate we will make more significant, partial sales of core positions and receive a $500 million dividend from Baker Hughes Incorporated upon the closing of its merger with General Electric's oil and gas division. Combined, these actions should adequately fund new investments, given the current market environment,"" he added.",2017-04-12
"Bank earnings are upon us. Optimism on the economy is running high, and banks are supposed to be able to demonstrate that. More demand for loans! Steeper yield curve!

But there are concerns. Investors are trying to reconcile a more optimistic outlook on the economy with troubling trends in bond yields and loan growth.

Here's the problem: a lot is expected to go right with bank earnings. Financials are expected to see a 15 percent gain in earnings in the first quarter. That is a lot. The gain is based on expectations that interest rates would be moving up, loan growth would improve, and credit risks would remain low.

But it's not quite playing out that way. Here's what's happening.

Interest rates are indeed up — the 10-year yield was at roughly 1.75 percent a year ago, it's at roughly 2.35 percent today. That's a big jump, 60 basis points, and it's happened because the Fed has been raising rates and inflation expectations are higher. But rates have been trending downward recently--we were at 2.6% a month ago. What's that all about? How can investors reconcile expected Fed rate hikes with rates trending lower? That's a problem. There has been some cracks in the credit market. For example, delinquencies have been rising on auto loans and non-prime card loans. It's small, but it has investors talking. Most importantly, loan growth has been anemic. How anemic? Total loan growth is up only 0.4% in Q1 compared to the same period last year, and has been particularly disappointing with Commercial & Industrial (C&I) loans, where there has been virtually no growth:

Bank lending

(Q1, year-over-year)

Total loan growth up 0.4%

Commercial/Industrial up 0.1%

Consumer up 0.5%

Commercial Real Estate up 2.0%

Mortgages down 0.1%

Source: Susquehanna

These are disappointing numbers, because loan growth trends were stronger last year. What happened? Susquehanna's bank analyst, Jack Micenko, believes part of the problem is that banks are simply changing the way they borrow money: many banks are paying off their bank loans and going to the bond market for money. He also believes there is continuing deleveraging in loans in the energy sector.

But Micenko admits these reasons can account for only part the disappointing numbers. Here's another alarming statistic: bank deposits are up 0.7% in the first quarter.

Deposits are up, but loan growth is flat. That is not a good sign, Micenko notes. ""In an expansionary environment, you see deposits go down and loan growth going up. The opposite is happening.""

Micenko's conclusion: ""Corporate America is sitting on their hands, and we don't know why. The optimism has not found its way into corporate behavior.""

So who's right, the bulls or the bears? We don't know yet, and that is why there is so much interest in bank earnings and particularly in the management outlook. They will avoid talking about Trump tax cuts but they can't avoid talking about loan growth and why bond yields are moving down and what the impact of a flatter yield curve will mean for them.

For the moment, the optimists are still in charge. Bank stocks (KBE) are 10% off their recent multiyear highs in early March but still nearly 20% above where they were on the eve of the election (the S&P 500 is up only 10%).

There's several reasons bulls still have the upper hand, for the moment:

Bank stocks are still comparatively cheap on a forward earnings basis. Evercore ISI notes that banks are trading at 12.3 times 2018 EPS estimates, up from just 11.7 times earnings pre-election. None of the analysts have incorporated any benefits from the Trump Agenda (tax cuts, infrastructure, less regulations) in 2017 earnings. Bank CEOs have not yet signaled alarm at the lower loan growth trends. They have acknowledged weak loan trends, but most have reiterated full year growth expectations.

Bottom line: a lot is riding on the commentary of a couple dozen bank CEOs in the next few weeks.",2017-04-11
"Fmr. American Airlines CEO: Oscar Munoz did 'exactly the right thing' Tuesday, 11 Apr 2017 | 4:16 PM ET | 05:10

Somebody made a big mistake by dragging a passenger from a United flight, but the airline's CEO did ""exactly the right thing"" by apologizing on Tuesday, former American Airlines CEO Bob Crandall told CNBC.

In his latest statement, United CEO Oscar Munoz said the airline took ""full responsibility"" and vowed that a thorough review would take place.

""Like you, I continue to be disturbed by what happened on this flight and I deeply apologize to the customer forcibly removed and to all the customers aboard. No one should ever be mistreated this way,"" Munoz said in a statement.

""That's what he should have said yesterday. He knows that now,"" Crandall said in an interview with ""Closing Bell"" on Tuesday.

Munoz's apology came a day after video of Dr. David Dao of Kentucky being dragged off an overbooked flight went viral on social media. The confrontation happened on a United Express flight operated by Republic Airways.

The CEO at first apologized for having to ""re-accommodate"" customers after a two-hour delay. He also sent a letter to employees Monday evening that claimed employees ""followed established procedures"" when removing the passenger from the plane.

Shares of United dropped on Tuesday and were among the worst performers in the S&P 500. The stock ultimately closed down just over 1 percent.

""Somebody made a big-time mistake. They shouldn't have done it and they know they shouldn't have done it,"" Crandall said. ""I'm sure it's taught everybody a useful lesson and hopefully everybody can now move on.""

The incident has shone a light on the practice by airlines to overbook flights, causing people to be bumped. However, Crandall pointed out that ""a very, very big majority"" give up their seats voluntarily.

And he believes industry will continue to try to find ways to entice people to do so.

""The way you get people off is you raise the price to get people to voluntarily give up their seats. You don't get on and drag somebody off, and I think everyone in the Western world now knows that,"" Crandall said.",2017-04-11
"As quarterly earnings season kicks into gear this week, no sector will be more important than banks.

Besides being a pivotal growth engine for the U.S. economy, the industry will serve as a barometer for what to expect in the era of a volatile new president and the first sustained interest rate increases in more than a decade.

On the surface, there's reason for optimism: Profits are expected to be robust enough that the group will show the sharpest gains of any of the 11 S&P 500 sectors. For the quarter, banks as a particular group should show 10 percent earnings growth over the same period in 2016, while financials broadly probably grew 14.3 percent, according to FactSet projections this week.

However, that will tell only part of the story. Big banks start reporting Thursday, with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC on tap.",2017-04-11
"If the capital markets had to be characterized by one quality this year, it would be the low level of volatility. And if changes in investor behavior had to be characterized by one quality, it would be the rise of passive investing.

So are the two trends related?

Some experts, such as Sandler O'Neill research analyst Richard Repetto, see a connection.

""There's no one resounding answer to [why we've seen] this low volatility,"" Repetto, who covers the brokers and exchanges, said Tuesday on CNBC""s ""Trading Nation."" But the growth of assets in exchange-traded funds, which largely track indexes, ""has had some impact.""

Repetto pointed out that the first quarter of 2017 was the least volatile quarter for the S&P 500 in decades — which is just one among a host of stats showing how anomalous the lack of market movement has been.

Interestingly, this general decline in volatility has come in an environment in which it is not uncommon to see big volatility spikes in reaction to surprising events such as the U.K. vote to exit the European Union or Donald Trump's election.

The fact that the low level of realized volatility (which is distinct from, but largely explains, the low level of expected future volatility portrayed by the VIX) comes amid potentially anxiety-making world events leaves Repetto reaching for market structure-based causes.

""My explanation is that [high-frequency trading] and the growth of ETF assets are reducing volatility,"" Repetto wrote in a recent research note.

There may be something to this, acknowledged Seddik Meziani, professor of finance at Montclair State University's Feliciano School of Business.

""To a large extent, I disagree that low volatility is being caused by ETFs,"" Meziani, the author of three books about exchange-traded funds, told CNBC in a Thursday phone interview.

That said, ""I would go so far as to say that it's exacerbated by this new tool. I would grant that maybe volatility wouldn't reach these highs and lows as easily if ETFs weren't around"" given that ""now you can express your sentiment toward the economy a little more easily.""

Meziani's last point hints at a famous puzzle in finance. Why, academics such as Robert Shiller, have asked, are markets so much more volatile than the underlying economy?

""It has often been objected in popular discussions that stock price index are too 'volatile', i.e., that the movements in stock price indexes could not realistically be attributed to any objective new information, since movements in the indexes are 'too big' relative to actual subsequent movements in dividends,"" is how Shiller summed up the problem in a widely cited 1980 paper. And this was before stocks crashed in October 1987 for no apparent reason whatsoever.

When considered within this framework, it seems that fretting over the decline in volatility may be a bit silly — akin to demanding that a chef explain why a once-inedible dish no longer scorches the taste buds.

""If there is excess volatility due to non-fundamental reasons, eliminating it will result in lower volatility and more efficient markets,"" Stefano Giglio, associate professor of finance at the University of Chicago's Booth School at Business, wrote to CNBC on Monday.

""If market participants and arbitrageurs are able to eliminate some of the excess price fluctuations that are generated by deviations from fundamental values, this is certainly better for investors,"" Giglio added.

To be sure, it's far from obvious that a decline in volatility is good for investors.

As Ian Dew-Becker, assistant professor of finance at Northwestern's Kellogg school, pointed out in an email, it's hard to prove that equity volatility has indeed been higher than economic volatility.

On top of that, the recent decline in stock market volatility has come amid an ""extremely stable"" period for economic growth, which means that whether fundamental and actual volatility ""have gotten closer to each other is a separate question that I don't know the answer to.""

Finally, while reduced volatility lowers the risk of buying at a poor price, it also reduces the opportunity to buy at a great one.

Still, for the average investor who is more interested in seeing their money grow alongside the economy than in snatching up incredible bargains, the decline of volatility is probably a boon.

And the fact that one of the causes of this lower volatility may be their vehicle for doing so cheaply may be the icing on the cake.",2017-04-10
"Some events to keep an eye on this week:

On Monday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen delivers a speech at the University of Michigan's Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy. Why it matters: The Yellen Fed shook up the market last week with talk about starting to unload the $4.5 trillion in bonds it has accumulated over the past eight years. Any further clues from Yellen could move markets.

Tuesday brings a couple important economic indicators. There's a small business index reading before the market opens, then the monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, later in the morning. Why it matters: Yellen watches the JOLTS report closely for clues on the employment picture.

Elsewhere in the economy, there are counts on import and export prices Wednesday, produce prices on Thursday, and consumer prices as well as the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey on Friday. Why they matter: A disturbing piece of news Friday, namely that the Atlanta Fed had knocked its first-quarter GDP growth projection all the way down to 0.6 percent. That's another way of saying the economy did almost nothing to start the year. Incoming economic data, then, will help tell whether growth is ever going to start picking up.",2017-04-09
"When it comes to stocks over the next few months, one strategist is telling investors to look beyond the Trump administration and at the market's fundamentals instead.



The so-called ""Trump rally"" has seemed to cool off as stocks sit near all-time highs, but have generally traded in a range since the end of February. On that note, Eaton Vance's chief equity investment officer, Eddie Perkin, told CNBC that if investors look even deeper, the Trump rally may not be because of President Donald Trump after all.

""If we look at how the markets performed in the first quarter of the year, the stock market overall was very strong and I think a lot of people are attributing that to the Trump rally,"" Perkin said last week on CNBC's ""Futures Now.""

However, ""if you look at the underlying stocks and sectors that worked, it was actually the stocks that had lagged previously,"" he added.

Following the November election, investors had their eyes on a variety of sectors that they believed would benefit under Trump's pro-business and deregulation-based policies. Financials and materials, for example, were two of the hottest ""Trump trades"" in the first few months out of the election.

Yet now, financials have slumped and are sitting almost flat from the start of the year, and materials have actually faded away from their year to date highs and are trading sideways. Instead, technology and health care have become two of the best-performing sectors.

A '2018 story'

Health care, which has been in the spotlight due to stalled repeal and replace in Washington, is up over 7 percent year to date. Meanwhile tech has rallied nearly 12 percent in 2017. Tech stocks were expected to come under pressure as Trump aimed to target the H-1B visa hiring tool. T

he surge in both these groups leads Perkin to point out that the supposed Trump trades are not what have been driving the market this year.

So what should investors be looking at to get a read on the market? Perkin actually believes that earnings growth will be the biggest factor moving stocks and will set the markets up for the ""2018 story."" Analysts are predicting a second quarter straight of improved earnings, with Thomson Reuters IBES saying that if all earnings meet estimates, the S&P 500 Index would see 10 percent growth.

""I think the bull case for stocks is you've got a bit of earnings growth this year, and then you've got an inflection upward in 2018,"" said Perkin. ""If that doesn't come through, then I'm a little reluctant to bet on further multiple expansion from here.""

Perkin does believe, however, that should the Trump administration manage to pass a tax reform bill, then the markets will likely head higher off the news.

"Once again the markets have demonstrated what they care about the most: the Fed and how aggressive it may be on interest rates, and any threat to the Trump agenda.

Midday, the Fed's William Dudley told a luncheon crowd that the Fed may begin the process of shrinking its $4.5 trillion bond portfolio later this year and that there might be only a ""little pause"" in the Fed's rate hike plan.

That was viewed as mildly hawkish by the markets. The dollar and 10-year yields rose. Bank stocks rose modestly, as did the S&P, though the gains have not lasted. This is not surprising, since Dudley's comments mostly affirm what had come out of the Fed minutes, though the ""little pause"" comment is slightly more hawkish.

Contrast this to the past 24 hours, where we've had a series of high-drama events that haven't done much to move the markets for even a short period. We have had a high-stakes meeting between President Trump and President Xi of China, a Syrian missile strike, and a disappointing jobs report.

And the market reaction? The S&P 500 is flat.

True, the 10-year yield has had a rather wild 24-hour run, going from 2.34% last night, then down to 2.29% on the Syrian missile strike, then rallying back early in the morning to 2.33%, then plunging to 2.27% right after the disappointing jobs report (the lowest level since mid-November) — and now rallying back to 2.36% on the Dudley comments.

But all this is small potatoes compared to what happened Wednesday, when the Dow plunged 200 points after the Fed said they would be moving to reduce their balance sheet later this year and House speaker Paul Ryan said tax reform could take longer than health-care reform.

The bottom line: geopolitical risk is definitely back on the radar of stock traders, but other factors are much higher up on the risk list. The Trump agenda and the Fed are the two top risks, with — for the moment — the economy and geopolitical risk much further down.",2017-04-07
"In the medium and long term, Nuveen Asset Management's chief equity strategist Bob Doll is constructive on equities and risk assets.

But he is growing ""increasingly cautious"" on the market in the short term.



""We think economic sentiment may be too high and elevated confidence may make investors vulnerable to downside economic surprises. To be sure, we are not expecting a significant economic slowdown, but the nearly non-stop pace of positive economic data is unlikely to continue,"" Doll wrote in a recent note to clients.



He continued: ""At some point, a setback will likely be triggered by a manufacturing decline, soft oil prices, weakening data from China or some other factor, which could spark a risk-off phase.""



In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Doll said he doesn't see a substantial pullback in the horizon, but highlighted several recent economic and political developments that give him pause.



Institute for Supply Management published data Monday came in slightly above estimates and declined by a half percent month over month. And Doll noted House Speaker Paul Ryan's comments Wednesday in which he said the House of Representatives, the Senate and the White House ""aren't even on the same page yet on tax reform.""

An important indicator of economic strength will come on Friday morning, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the March employment report.

As for the markets' performance year to date, Doll said Thursday, ""It was big [cap] that led small [cap]. It was growth that led value. It was defensive that led the cyclicals. That isn't where we were last year, nor is it a sign that we're going straight up. It's just a little bit of a warning sign.""

Doll typically has a bullish tone. Toward the end of January, as the S&P 500 had risen about 6 percent after the U.S. election in November, he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that the rally still had room to run. And prior to that, in late November, he told CNBC that the S&P 500 would rise at the end of 2016 and at the end of 2017.



At this juncture, several internal market indicators are giving pause to Chris Verrone, head of technical analysis at Strategas Research Partners.



""This is a market that's really been consolidating for the last four or five weeks now,"" Verrone commented in an interview Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""



Verrone said that last week about 30 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 touched 20-day lows, and the market typically offers buyers better opportunities amid ""washed-out conditions"" when about half of the market hits the same milestone.",2017-04-06
"Private equity is taking off, and breaking records along the way.

In some ways, private equity's gain comes at the expense of hedge funds' losses. In others, it is simply emblematic of the tremendous amount of capital sloshing around the world, with few other places to invest after almost a decade of low interest rates.

North American funds secured their highest first-quarter fundraising total ever, raising $62 billion, according to data compiled by Preqin, an alternative assets research firm. Worldwide, 253 private capital funds ended their fundraising process in the quarter, hauling in $156 billion, the data showed, which was the best first quarter since right before the financial crisis.

The momentum is likely to continue into the second quarter, with more than 3,000 funds currently marketing to investors, according to Preqin.",2017-04-06
"Reducing the Fed's massive balance sheet could lead to higher rates sooner than some expected Thursday, 6 Apr 2017 | 9:01 AM ET | 00:47

Consider the Federal Reserve the Starship Enterprise of monetary policy: It went where no central bank had gone before, and now must plot the journey home.

The Fed already has begun one leg of the trip, as it has started raising interest rates from financial crisis-era lows. Now, it is preparing to embark on what could be the more perilous part — unwinding the $4.5 trillion of bonds it holds on its so-called balance sheet.

Central bank officials discussed in March how to address the balance sheet, according to minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee released Wednesday. While it may just sound like arcane monetary talk, the stakes are high both for investors and consumers.

Get it right, and the Fed will have pulled off what its critics thought impossible, namely embarking on unprecedented intervention in the markets with little consequence. Get it wrong and the fallout could be dramatic, including a sharp rise in interest rates and tumult in the stock and bond markets.",2017-04-06
"For one thing, the Fed could buy up most of the companies in the S&P 500. A full 315 individual companies, when counting from the bottom of the list by market capitalization. That includes well-known names like Viacom, Clorox and Expedia.

On the other end, the Fed's spending spree could purchase the top 10 companies: everything from Apple to Wells Fargo. That includes a lot of big outfits like Amazon, Alphabet and Exxon Mobil.

But the Fed maybe should have wound down its balance sheet years ago: A previous CNBC analysis showed that in December 2015, it could have afforded the 14 biggest companies in the index.

""Provided that the economy continued to perform about as expected, most participants anticipated that gradual increases in the federal funds rate would continue and judged that a change to the committee's reinvestment policy would likely be appropriate later this year,"" the March minutes said.

The Fed's balance sheet is around 24 percent of U.S. GDP, which is far above the historical average of around 6 percent. But other industrialized nations have asset-to-GDP ratios that are much higher. The Fed's total assets have plateaued in recent years while those of other central banks like Japan and the European Union have continued to rise.",2017-04-06
"Stocks that are commonly held as part of a broad investment portfolio can be considered conflicts of interest in the hands of powerful public servants. Other holdings could simply be considered unseemly.

At least three staffers invested in Rockwell Automation, which produces equipment and software to help factories increase their use of robotic workers — possibly a liability in an administration that has emphasized saving manufacturing jobs. And Liddell had up to $15,000 invested in Herbalife, the nutritional supplement company that's been the focus of a heated investor battle for years. The company was cleared by the Federal Trade Commission last summer of allegations that it operated a pyramid scheme.

Some of the biggest companies in the country are government contractors, and are well represented in White House staffers' portfolios. Contractors could be of particular interest to investors looking to trade based on the administration because their revenue is often highly dependent on decisions made in Washington.

All the big defense firms can be found in the financial disclosures, and many paid out healthy dividends last year. Liddell is also invested in General Dynamics, the defense contractor that produces missile and marine systems for the government, among other things. Both Liddell and Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short owned shares in Lockheed Martin.

At least four White House staff members owned shares in the defense contractor United Technologies. The company also is the parent of air conditioner manufacturer Carrier Corp, which made news in November when it was the first of many companies to attract Trump's wrath after it made plans to move jobs to Mexico. Trump announced that 1,100 of those jobs would be saved, though that number was later revised down to 800 jobs.

The filings do not indicate all of the stocks that will be divested as part of standard ethics screening. The White House said in a statement on March 31 that the disclosures were a snapshot in time and said reporters would have to seek out additional information on retained assets in the future.

""These are incredibly successful individuals, very high net worth, very sophisticated, complex asset structures, numerous sub-LLCs, trusts and other items, all of which have to be worked through,"" the statement said. ""And for those who are fans of 'Spinal Tap,' these were the 'elevens' out of ten on the scale.""",2017-04-06
"Traders tend to scoff when a policymaker plays investor, often referencing when then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan made a very early ""irrational exuberance"" call in December 1996, more than three years before the top of the dot-com bull market.

That skepticism was voiced again Wednesday when the Fed released its meeting minutes from March which read: ""Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased over the intermeeting period, and some measures of valuations, such as price-to-earnings ratios, rose further above historical norms. ... Some participants viewed equity prices as quite high relative to standard valuation measures.""

But traders shouldn't be so quick to dismiss these comments from Fed officials. History shows when worries about valuation appear in these official minutes, stocks often struggle in the following year.

We found six mentions of an overvalued stock market in the minutes by searching the Fed's website for the word ""valuation"" going back to 1996. According to Kensho, here's the performance of the major market averages one year after the meeting when such a mention took place.

What's interesting is that these mentions didn't always occur at the end of bull markets. The officials' discussion of an overvalued stock market often came before long pauses during bull markets when equity valuations were able to come back in line because of a period of consolidation.

So this doesn't mean the end of the bull is near, but it could be another reason to believe we're in for a long period of sideways trading until earnings can catch up.

Here are the specific mentions of high ""valuation"" in the minutes, according to the Fed's website, along with the S&P 500's subsequent return from the meeting when that mention was made.

Meeting: April 28-29 — 2015 S&P 500 return 1-year later: -1.97%

""However, some indicators suggested that valuations remained stretched for some asset classes. An estimate of the expected real return on equities moved down, reflecting an increase in stock prices and downward revisions to forecasts of corporate earnings, and corporate bond spreads declined somewhat.""

Sept. 16-17, 2014 — S&P 500 return 1-year later: -0.57%

""Some financial developments that could undermine financial stability over time were noted, including a deterioration in leveraged lending standards, stretched stock market valuations, and compressed risk spreads.""

Jan. 27-28, 2004 — S&P 500 return 1-year later: +3.8%

""A number of members commented that expectations of sustained policy accommodation appeared to have contributed to valuations in financial markets that left little room for downside risks, and the change in wording might prompt those markets to adjust more appropriately to changing economic circumstances in the future.""

Dec. 11, 2001 — S&P 500 return 1-year later: -20.39%

""Among those risks, members cited the apparently reduced prospects for additional fiscal stimulus legislation, the vulnerability of current stock market valuations should forecasts of a robust rebound in earnings fail to materialize, the possibility of further terrorist incidents, and especially the potentially adverse effect on consumer confidence and spending of additional deterioration in labor market conditions.""

March 21, 2000 — S&P 500 return 1-year later: -24.88%

""The divergence, at least until recently, in the stock market between the valuations of high-tech firms and those of more traditional, established firms was inducing a redirection of investment funds to business activities that were perceived to be more productive. While the associated capital investments undoubtedly had contributed to the acceleration in productivity, some members expressed concern that the historically elevated valuations of many high-tech stocks were subject to a sizable market adjustment at some point. That risk was underscored by the increased volatility of the stock market.""

Dec. 17, 1996 — S&P 500 return 1-year later: 32.99%

""The rise over recent years had been extraordinary and had brought market valuations to fairly high levels relative to earnings and dividends. In these circumstances, the members recognized the need to monitor with special care price movements in the stock market and asset markets more generally for their implications for consumer and other spending.""

"I spent part of the morning with the management team at Hess Midstream Partners, a Master Limited Partnership (MLPs) that had an impressive debut at the NYSE today, opening at $25.50 after pricing $14.78 million shares at $23, way above price talk of $12 million shares at $19-$21.

The management team was all smiles, and with good reason. Floating an IPO, for all the planning that goes into it, is largely a matter of timing. Timing on the state of the IPO market, on the state of the stock market, and on the desirability of the product you are offering, which is often dependent on how hot your sector is.

The timing for Hess could not have been better:

1) The desirability of the product: Hess is a desirable yield play. An initial yield of 6 percent, one which is growing. That will immediately attract a lot of large institutions.

In addition, the oil market is in at least a short-term uptrend. Crude has done a perfect U-turn in the last month, going from $52 to $46 and back to $52. That has lifted oil stocks, including the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP), a basket of MLPs, which is up about 3 percent in the last two weeks.

Pay no attention to the nonsense talk that MLPs are just toll keepers for oil and gas moving through their systems and are not sensitive to the price of oil. The Alerian MLP ETF fell apart when oil fell apart (beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014) right along with the rest of the energy sector.

2) The state of the IPO market: the IPO market has had several successful IPOs recently, including Snap, and recent IPOs have outperformed the market. The Renaissance Capital IPO ETF (IPO), a basket of the 60 most recent IPOs, is up about 11 percent this year, nearly twice the gain of the S&P 500. The dearth of recent IPOs has created demand for quality products, and there has been a particularly dearth of energy IPOs and MLPs.

3) The state of the stock market. Leon Cooperman's comment on the markets on CNBC on Wednesday reflects the sentiment of the majority of traders: ""Conditions that would bring a significant market decline are not present.""

Sure, there's plenty of debate about growth prospects and the probability that all or part of the Trump Agenda will be enacted, but the S&P is less than two percent from its historic high.

Bottom line: current market conditions are favorable for IPOs. I said a month ago that there would be a week in April when we will suddenly have seven or eight IPOs in a single week. This week we will likely have six.

I'm sticking by my prediction.",2017-04-05
"While some investors may be concerned about market valuations and whether President Donald Trump can get his agenda enacted, expert Oliver Pursche doesn't see an end for the rally just yet.

""We continue to invest. We continue with our thesis that it's going to be somewhat of a bell curve of a market. And we don't see the Trump rally, as it's been called, ending any time in the immediate future,"" the CEO of Bruderman Brothers said in an interview with ""Closing Bell"" on Tuesday.

While first-quarter earnings will be critical, Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker's resignation is probably bullish for stocks. Plus, there is still the expectation that the Trump administration will be able to pass some type of regulatory and tax reform.

""So on an all-on basis, with earnings expected to grow by 10 percent year over year, we think that the environment is still very well poised for well-managed, strong-balance sheet companies,"" he noted.

That said, his year-end target on the S&P 500 is 2,300, which it has already passed. He is anticipating it to go back down before rallying again — which he said is a normal cycle at this stage in a bull market.

While stocks ran up after Trump's victory in November, they are about 1.5 percent off its highs. On Tuesday, U.S. stocks ended mostly flat.

Kenny Polcari, director at O'Neil Securities, said the recent pullback isn't any reason to panic.

""What you're going to see is as there's more discussion, then you're going to see it start to affect how investors perceive market value at the moment,"" he told ""Closing Bell.""

Barry James, president of James Advantage Funds, believes the market rally is built on ""shaky foundation.""

""You've got a lot of margin debt today. You've got a lot of people buying passive. And we see the market as turned upside down, where the cheap stocks aren't doing as well as the expensive ones and the poor earnings stocks are doing better than the good earnings stocks.""

He believes the market is currently in a ""pit stop"" and it remains to be seen if there will be a ""massive overhaul"" or a ""quick refuel and go again.""

"I just finished my usual round of calls to a few trading desks, and I heard a familiar refrain: Volume and volatility are low. The stock trading business is slow.

This has been going for a long time, but the complaints are getting louder, and we are seeing firms take action.

Back to the question: Why are volume and volatility so low? It's not an illusion. One measure, realized volatility — which is the actual volatility of the S&P 500 over successive 30-day periods — is near historic lows.

This bothers traders, and not just because it's bad for business, but because it seems, darn it, that there should be more volatility. It seems to most of them that given uncertainty in Europe, uncertainty with the Trump agenda, and uncertainty with the global economy, well, it just seems like the Volatility Index should be a lot higher than 12.

Larry Tabb, one of the best market structure experts in the country over at Tabb Group, expressed the frustration perfectly to me: ""I have no clue why the VIX is at 11 / 12 instead of 16 or 18."" He notes that given the defeat of health care and a budget that looks pretty problematic, you could argue the VIX should be closer to 20.

There are several explanations for why the markets seem so sluggish:

1) Thanks to advances in trading technology, the market has become extremely efficient. ""With automated traders and news box traders the prices of stocks — supply and demand — is extremely efficient,"" Sean Hendelman at T3 Trading Group told me. ""Not only that, when there is news on a stock or industry group the speed at which the underlying names are efficiently priced is almost immediate.""

Other changes in trading methodologies may also be making the markets less volatile. ""I think that many of the countermeasures that investors now use in portfolio construction, dynamic asset allocation, hedging, structured trades, are designed to reduce volatility, and collectively they may be working,"" George Calhoun, Director of the Quantitative Finance Program at the Stevens Institute of Technology, told me.

2) Exchange-traded funds are reducing volatility because you can trade the ETFs without trading the underlying stocks. This makes some sense; the whole move to passive investing has likely tamped down volatility. ""No one is figuring out if Coca-Cola or Pepsi should be worth more or less — folks are just buying Coke and Pepsi based upon their market cap,"" Tabb noted.

3) The Fed has tamped down volatility for years by keeping rates low and essentially encouraging people to buy equities due to its quantitative easing program. While that is now ending, continuing quantitative easing programs by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the European Central Bank (ECB) are tamping down volatility overseas.

""The Fed has passed the baton to the ECB and the BoJ,"" said Peter Cecchini, co-head of Equities at Cantor Fitzgerald.

He noted that the ECB continues to buy corporate debt, keeping refinancing rates low globally, and the BoJ is acting directly on risky assets by buying ETFs and equities.

All this low volume and low volatility is having an impact on the stock trading business. It doesn't matter the markets are near new highs. If no one is trading, or everyone is moving to passive investing, well, that is a big problem.

This has now gone on so long that firms are acting.

Last week, The Wall Street Journal ran a big story about how BlackRock was moving toward computer programs to help pick stocks, rather than humans, for its actively managed portfolios.

Than word came that high-frequency trading firm Virtu Financial was making an offer to buy Knight Capital. High frequency firms thrive on high volatility, and without it they are struggling to grow as well.

Today we learn that Cowen is purchasing fellow trading firm Convergex for $116 million.

What's it all mean? It means it's tough out there. It means that the trading world is changing fast, and that firms must find ways to reduce costs or gain economies of scale.

Oh sure, the VIX will pop again in response to some external event. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about day in and day out, average trading with no big catalyst.

I'm talking about whether there is some long-term structural issue that is keeping volatility low, and it certainly does appear that way.

"After an extraordinarily strong first quarter for the major averages, Cramer says Wall Street is ready for some profit-taking.

""At the very least, we should probably give back some of these big gains, particularly the ones that to me seem artificial, meaning they were created by motivated buyers who moved the stocks themselves in order to enhance their first quarter performance,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.

Cramer's top five names for the second quarter are all first-quarter winners, the top performers in the S&P 500 that should continue their ascents barring any major crises along the way.

The most actionable of all was video game maker Activision Blizzard, creator of the popular Call of Duty franchise and an integral name to own in the age of the stay-at-home economy.

""Of all the winners so far, I think this is the one that you can buy right here, right now, and then hopefully buy even more of on a pullback,"" Cramer said.

But even as stay-at-home and e-commerce stocks thrive, Cramer noticed names like Marriott, Wyndham, CBS, and 21st Century Fox staying afloat as their executives buy back stock not because they are saving face, but because they believe in their continued success, Cramer said.

Despite the rise of names like Airbnb in the hotel space, more traditional hotel chains are not suffering.

""Turns out that Airbnb, as successful as it is, can't possibly meet the incredible amount of demand and it isn't nearly as big a threat as the marketplace thought it was,"" Cramer said.

And social media did not wreak as much havoc on television as the bears may have thought, with only Google and Facebook wielding the power that would be needed to put a dent in networks like Fox and CBS.

""After all, the CEOs see the actual order books, they know the numbers, and with both television and hotels, you'd have done much better to listen to them rather than the short-sellers. In fact, these could be terrific places to go if we get the drift lower that I am expecting right into earnings season,"" Cramer said.",2017-04-03
"At least five IPOs are seeking to raise roughly $1.5 billion this week, and some are fairly well-known names, including two transportation giants:

1) Schneider National, the second-largest U.S. trucking company, will go public at the NYSE on Thursday.

2) Azul, Brazil's third-largest airline, founded by JetBlue founder David Neeleman, is set to begin trading at the NYSE on Friday.

3) Hess Midstream, a Master Limited Partnership (MLP) that owns oil and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities in the Bakken Shale formation in North Dakota, is set to go public at the NYSE on Wednesday. It's the first midstream company since Noble Midstream, with a juicy six-percent yield.

4) Elevate Credit , which provides online loans and lines of credit to non-prime consumers, is set to trade at the NYSE on Thursday, trying to revive their IPO after pulling it over a year ago, and

5) Okta, which provides identity management software, is set to begin trading at the NASDAQ on Friday.

What's fueling the fuller calendar?

1) A record stock market. The S&P hit another historic high in early March, and while it ended the month down slightly, the longer-term uptrend was still intact.

2) A solid first quarter for IPOs. Twenty-five IPOs raised $10 billion, according to Renaissance Capital, far above the measly eight that went public in the first quarter of 2015.

3) Solid after-market returns. The Renaissance IPO ETF, a basket of the last 60 or so IPOs, was up roughly 12% in the first quarter, better than twice the performance of the S&P 500.

There's more in the pipeline: at least five more for next week and possibly more. Would you believe a coal company? Just this morning Warrior Met Coal, a producer and exporter of metallurgical coal, announced terms for an IPO likely to happen at the NYSE next week.

Also next week: Yext, which allows businesses to sync local listings across the internet; Netshoes, an online sports retailer; and Cadence Bancorp, a Texas-based bank; and Tocagen, a cancer biotech company.
